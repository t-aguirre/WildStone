## Concept

WildStones is a team project for the Wild Code School. 
It's based on Hearthstone strategy card game and it's aim to introduce the player to a simpler version of the game. 
Alternatively, he can choose to play to a memory card game.


## Configuration:

This is a React Vite project which has been configured with these tools:

- _Husky_ : Allows to execute specific commands that trigger on _git_ events
- _Vite_ : Alternative to _Create-React-App_, packaging less tools for a more fluid experience
- _ESLint_ : "Quality of code" tool, ensures chosen rules will be enforced
- _Prettier_ : "Quality of code" tool as well, focuses on the styleguide
